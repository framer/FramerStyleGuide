### Framer Writing Style Guide
Use this style guide as a suggestion for your writing, but not a set of hard rules. Our goal for offering this guide is to align all writing efforts for consistency, but not uniformity. Great writing is expressive and we'd never want to limit you. Use the ideas presented here as a foundation.

This is a living document. Framer's brand will naturally evolve over time, and your writing is a major component in that. So, when you write about Framer, keep in mind our core goals, audience, voice, and tone. However, do challenge us where we need to grow.

#### Writing Principles
1. Write how you speak.
2. Avoid programming jargon when possible.
3. Emphasize an outcome.
4. Relate to tasks designers already do.
5. Be specific and explicit.
6. Voice and tone are more important than grammar.

#### Audience
The most important part of great writing is understanding the reader. At Framer, we have the luxury of writing for designers. When you write for Framer, remember that our audience is professional, highly skilled, and exceptionally creative. However, Framer's designer audience also represents a spectrum of skills and experience levels. As the line between programming and design continues to blur, so does the definition of Framer's audience. The result is that sometimes a programmer will be using Framer and thus will be reading what you are about to write.

However, don't let this distinction distract you. With all writing for Framer, we default to a specific reader archetype: **An established designer who has limited coding ability.**

Some readers will be advanced coders or even have computer science degrees, but write about Framer as if the reader has basic understanding about programming and significant design experience. This way, the more technically-challenging aspects of using Framer will be less intimidating to our core audience, and the purpose of using Framer will be abundantly clear: achieving great design.

## Audience Challenges & Goals
The design profession is changing. Coding skill is increasingly becoming a requirement, and designers view this as a significant hurdle. They've read the articles and books about how designers should learn to code, but it's overwhelming. These are people who are already experts in one field, and who now feel they must master an expansive second profession simply to continue working.

At Framer, this is where our opportunity lies. We are in a unique position to advance the design profession and increase a designer's output while only requiring a small investment to learn simple coding. We're a simple alternative when designing in the browser with HTML and CSS requires a designer to possess substantial knowledge before earning even minimal return.

### Designer Challenges
- Learning to code
  1. Intimidating
  2. Takes a long time to see results
  3. Feels disconnected from the creative process
  4. Coding limits creativity

- Designs are never built with 100% accuracy
  1. Developers don't understand my designs
  2. Mockups don't always translate to code perfectly

- Standard tools only work for limited aspects of design
  1. Cannot explore animation in Sketch/Photoshop
  2. Creating responsive design is complex
  3. Unable to make certain design decisions until I can try out the interface

### Designer Goals
- Explore every aspect of design
  1. Visual
  2. User Experience
  3. Animation
  4. Creative and new interfaces

- Nail the implementation faster
  1. Lose less when designs are translated into code
  2. Communicate design ideas more clearly

- Make functional and beautiful design that we can be proud of!

## Our Values at Framer
Framer is a new kind of design tool: one that changes how designers can shape digital products. Our users are blurring the traditional distinction between designers and developers. Framer adds exploration and discovery to the design process where it was impossible previously.

### Interaction
Images and words have dominated how we communicate ideas. With them, we've explained and defined how products work. But they're inadequate to define how products feel. To understand the potential of our ideas, we need to be able to interact with them.

### Creativity
Framer offers a playground to tinker with interactivity and learn how to code. Learning to code is challenging, but it's value is inevitable and obvious. Once grasped, the creative possibilities are only limited by your imagination.

Many designers see code as a threat to creativity. Framer turns this expectation on its head and empowers creatives to explore ideas in even greater depth.

### Evolution of Design
The nature of design is always changing, and we see interactive prototyping as the next adaptation. Framer is pushing the profession forward by providing a way to explore more ideas and greater depth. Designs made using Framer along the way are more effective because the designer has control over everything and the freedom to explore every idea.

We believe its approach is a logical step for digital creativity. Our community of designers around the world and at companies like Dropbox, Google, Apple, Twitter, Facebook and at Berkeley and Carnegie Mellon think the same.

## Tone
Tone should change with each situation, such as for documentation, support, marketing, etc. When writing for Framer, choose your tone to match the reader's mindset and emotional state.

See the examples section below.

## Voice
Always consistent--this doesn't change across any content type. While tone is empathetic and dependent upon the reader, voice is about Framer's brand and values. Rely upon the "Our Values at Framer" section above.

Here's a list of adjectives describing Framer's voice.

Aspirational but not Pretentious

Ambitious but not Grandiose

Creative but not Frivolous

Practical but not Stuffy

Meticulous but not Fussy

Friendly but not Funny

## The Benefits of Using Framer
Write about the outcome that happens when a designer uses Framer, not just about its features.

There are many other prototyping tools available, and discussing the difference in features isn't enough to help users make a decision about which to choose. So, beyond explaining features, demonstrate their value.

To do this, you'll rely upon your understanding of designers, their challenges, and their goals. here are some examples:

Feature

Benefit

Animation

Explore design in greater depth

Prototype using code

More control over the interaction

Import from Sketch/Photoshop

Uses familiar tools, doesn't replace workflow

Uses CoffeeScript

Only need basic coding knowledge, unlike prototyping in HTML/CSS

## Overcoming Objections
Using the knowledge about Framer and our audience, you should answer questions like these in your writing:
- As a designer, why would I want to prototype in the first place?
- How is Framer better than other prototyping tools?
- If I am not comfortable writing code, can I use Framer?

## Content Types & Examples
### Documentation
While using programming terms is unavoidable, assume basic programming knowledge and avoid advanced concepts if possible. Documentation should explain only Framer's features, and not CoffeeScript, JavaScript, Sketch, Photoshop, etc.

Our documentation is not a programming tutorial, so don't explain programming syntax or methods unless they are unique to Framer. However, do refer the reader to programming tutorials (including our own) where appropriate and when possible. The [CoffeeScript documentation](http://coffeescript.org/#language) is a great resource to suggest.

#### Incorrect
Printing allows you to inspect variables on runtime. It works similarly to console.log, only when using print, the output is shown directly within your prototype. Note that you need to use print() in Javascript (but not in CoffeeScript). We will omit these in the rest of the docs.

Printing allows you to inspect variables on runtime. It works similarly to console.log, but the output is shown directly on top of your prototype in Framer Studio.

### Marketing
All marketing content should mirror our audience's challenges and suggest a better outcome that is achieved using Framer.

#### Incorrect Headline
Invent, design and experiment with interaction

This headline is vague and disconnected from our audience's challenges. It does not explain how Framer is different from any other prototyping tool, and worse, does not even indicate that Framer is a prototyping tool.

#### Correct Headline
Prototype insightful design with simple-to-learn coding

This new headline addresses the audience's fear of coding while hinting at an outcome: a more insightful design. It also presents Framer as a prototyping tool.

#### Incorrect Sentence
Connect pixels to behavior and discover exciting new ways of interaction design.

This sentence is certainly clever, but that cleverness could prevent readers from understanding what Framer does. Further, the outcome is vague: what is a "new way of interaction design"? What about it is exciting?

#### Correct Sentence
Bring your design to life. Try expressive animations and create innovative interactions.

This sentence is more specific and is something designers will get excited about. But, notice it doesn't use the word "exciting". Framer is an exciting product, and simply by explaining it clearly, we can show how exciting it is.

### Transactional
Transactional content, such as the email confirmation and receipt which Framer customers receive after purchase, should be friendly but direct. Keep the writing brief in order to get to the important information.

Don't be overly formal or impersonal; such language can delay getting to the point. Also, the Framer brand is friendly, and we want to build relationships with our users and not seem another stuffy software company.

#### Incorrect

### Educational
Our training and educational content is a place to build rapport with new users. It's our chance to give back to the design community by sharing our expertise.

When writing tutorials or courses for Framer, don't be salesy. Don't try to push people to purchase. Instead, make the value of Framer obvious by showing off what it can do. Educate them without asking anything in return. We know that when people understand Framer, they'll see its value and purchase.

However, we don't need to hide the fact that we're a for-profit company, either. Be honest and genuine while delivering great educational content.

#### Incorrect
This tutorial is about basic programming concepts with CoffeeScript (If you enjoy it, support us by purchasing our product, Framer). CoffeeScript is great for new programmers because of the easy syntax. You don't even need to use parentheses in function calls.

This asks the reader to purchase before we've even provided any value or earned their trust. It's also impersonal and uses programming jargon.

Correct

In this tutorial, you'll learn basic programming concepts with CoffeeScript. If you are fairly new to coding, I highly recommend that you try CoffeeScript, because you'll gain understanding of important concepts but with very easy-to-write code. In fact, we love CoffeeScript so much that we built our interactive prototyping tool, Framer, on top of it. Read this tutorial and I bet you'll feel the same way.

This version is much more friendly and relatable. It doesn't hide the fact that the tutorial is written by someone working for Framer, but it doesn't sound like a sales pitch, either.

### Social Media
Instead of using social media as a press release feed, use it to connect with our users on a more personal level. Social Media is very informal, and while Framer is a company, we are a team of real people and shouldn't be afraid to show it.

#### Incorrect Feature Release Tweet
We just released Framer Studio 1.10 with major editor improvements and much more devices. [http://framerjs.tumblr.com/post/110641414997/editor-and-devices](http://framerjs.tumblr.com/post/110641414997/editor-and-devices) ...

This tweet is impersonal and stuffy. Our audience doesn't care about software versioning or vague "major improvements". They want to know how Framer will help them make great design.

Correct Feature Release Tweet

Now you can prototype iPhone 6+ and Apple Watch apps using Framer. We also improved the code editor to make your life easier. [http://framerjs.tumblr.com/post/110641414997/editor-and-devices](http://framerjs.tumblr.com/post/110641414997/editor-and-devices) ...

Instead of talking about Framer (we), the tweet talks about the user (you). Further, it's specific, so the reader can decide if they're interested before clicking the link.
